Hey! this is a little ToDo app made with React and currently is displayed well only in pc resolutions.

The app was created using the hooks useReduce, useEffect and the custom hook useForm.

You can create, delete, toggle and count the different tasks.

Im very proud of the progress i have made since i started learning react so any tips or feedback would be very apreciated.
